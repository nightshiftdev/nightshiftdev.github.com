    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am sorry to announce that the GroceryPro project have been abandoned. There is NOT going to be any further development on GroceryPro.</p>

<p><del>
New GroceryPro in development!</p>

<p><del>
We believe "you are what you eat". The food industry bombards us with artificial products, preservatives and foods based on GMOs.</p>

<p><del>
This is why we decided to start working on a new version of GroceryPro; one that will take the app to the next level!</p>

<p><del>
The new GroceryPro will take care of you and the planet, and encourage you to make healthier decisions. It is going to be about:  fast, intelligent list creation, organized shopping, healthy, balanced meals and a happy planet.</p>

<p><del>
Some of the new “technical” features will include:</p>

<ul>
<li><del>Storing lists and recipes in the cloud </li>
<li><del>User to user list and recipe sharing</li>
<li><del>Easy way to follow users, or rather, their meal recipes ;)</li>
<li><del>Convenient ways to create grocery lists from recipes</li>
</ul>


<p><del>
We are planning to make the application FREE (ad-based).</p>

<p><del>
If you are looking for a revolutionary, interactive shopping list, we hope the new GroceryPro will be your number one choice.</p>

<p><del>
Stay tuned for more GroceryPro dev news!</p>

<p><del>
P.S. We have 1000 beta testing spots available, so let us know if you’d like to take part in the
development of GroceryPro. If you are interested, send us PM on <a href="https://facebook.com/GroceryProApps">facebook</a> or e-mail us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x67;&#114;&#111;&#x63;&#101;&#114;&#x79;&#112;&#114;&#111;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x67;&#114;&#x6f;&#99;&#x65;&#x72;&#121;&#x70;&#x72;&#111;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife prepared an amazing surprise for us for our third wedding anniversary; she bought two tickets for the <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/">Cirque Du Soleil</a>.
I was thrilled with the acrobatic performance and stunned by the colors in the show.</p>

<p>As you might remember from my previous post: <a href="/blog/2012/10/07/where-it-all-began/">"Where it all began..."</a> my brother and I are "nightshift" mobile game developers; so, the day after the show I called to persuade him that we needed to create an acrobatic circus-like game with changing colors, fireworks and explosions. We wanted to create a game play experience similar to the one spectators experienced in the circus show; an experience where the player would need to use speed, concentration and agile capabilities to beat the levels - similar to a juggling performance.</p>

<p>We started prototyping and thinking about the game play... using convenient and quite inexpensive <a href="http://www.paperprototyping.com/">Paper Prototyping</a> technique ;-).</p>

<p><img src="/images/colage.png" alt="picture alt" /></p>

<p>We decided to create a game similar to "ball brick breaker" games except ours would take place in a moving tunnel with wavy colorful walls and multiple balls that would simulate a juggling experience.</p>

<p>Once we knew what we were trying to build, my brother started preparing static graphics, music and sound effects. I, on the other hand, started scratching my head trying to figure out how I would create a tunnel with constantly changing stripes and awesome colors like I saw in the <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/">Cirque Du Soleil</a> show.</p>

<p><img src="/images/KoozaCirqueduSoleil.jpg" alt="picture alt" /></p>

<p>After "wrestling" with different ways of generating tunnels with wavy colorful walls for about a week or two I finally had the moving tunnel!</p>

<p><img src="/images/TJ_screenshot.png" alt="picture alt" /></p>

<p>I don't want to bore with technical details of the implementation here; however, if you're interested in how to achieve this kind of effect in your game you can find an awesome step-by-step guide to a similar technique at a very popular <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/3888/how-to-create-a-game-like-tiny-wings-part-1">Ray Wenderlich Forum</a>. (Unfortunately, I found this after I already made my tunnel work :-( ...don't make the same mistake; don't waste your time reinventing something that somebody already published.)</p>

<p>Several months later, working evenings and weekends, we finally released <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunnel-juggler/id551349666?mt=8">Tunnel Juggler</a>.</p>

<p>So... Ladies and Gentleman,  please welcome on the stage this evening's entrainment, the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tunnel-juggler/id551349666?mt=8">Tunnel Juggler</a>. We appreciate all your feedback, ideas for improvements and critiques.</p>
